From a human perspective, JSON is easier to read. We can clearly see what each piece of informaiton is (for example, we can look at the first entry and see the course, student name, etc.). For a developer, debugging and software testing would be easier in this format because the program logic is simple to interpret. The data format and program logic becomes self-evident, helping to avoid misinterpreting data.

JSON is easier for a computer to use as well because it has a lighter format compared to XML, all computers have libraries to read JSON, and it can be natively read by JavaScript (Bolton).
